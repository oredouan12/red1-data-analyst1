									<h2>Qatar Football world cup winner predition Model</h2><br> <h4> using simple Poission Distribution</h4>
									<h4>Introduction & User Story</h4>
									<p> This Project is showing the probability of teams scoring goals against each other by using the Poisson Distribution and the 3 first rounds of 2022 Qatar Football World Cup dataset, which is more accurate, with the Poisson distribution. This Project explains in-depth the Poisson distribution and models the probability of Each Qualified Team scoring each other using the Poisson Distribution based on the real dataset of the 3 first rounds of 2022 Qatar Football World.<br>
                                    <h4>Objectives</h4>
1- Calculate the probability of scoreline between the remaining teams in 2022 football world cup starting from Round16, and use it to calculate match odds(Home/Draw/Away).<br>
2- Making more Well-informed football prediction and help find the qualified team from each round of World Cup.<br>
<br>
                                    <h4>What is Poission Distribution</h4>
1- Developed by 19th-century French Matematician Simeon Denis Poisson.<br>
2- It is a probability theory that uses historical sports data to predict the outcomes of sports event. It measures the likelihood of how many times an event will occur during a specific period.<br>
3- Poisson distribution can help you predict how likely each number of goals scored is.<br>
<br>
<h4>Why use Poisson Distribution?</h4>
1 - As a morocccan citizen and big fun of football, the moroccan team is already qualified and it is important to know how likely any event is, based on past performance.<br>

2- Poisson Distribution in predicting the winner is particulary relevant for games like football, where scoring happens on an incremental scale. it helps you determine the likelihood of each possible score.<br><br>
</p>                               
<h4>Using simple Poission Distribution to predict Qatar World Cup Winner </h4>
<p>One of the most common uses of Poisson Distribution: Calculating Football Results:<br>

If you want to calculate the likelihood of a specific score in football, as well as a win, lose or draw, You need to first calculate the average goal expectancy, as well as the attack strenght, and defence strenght for both sides of the event.<br><br>
Each Team goal expectancy depends on its attack strenght and defence strenght, and as well as the opposite team's Attack strenght and defence strenght.<br><br>
<img src="images/Total Goals Scored and conceded.jpg">

<h5>Calculating Attack Strenght:</h5>
With these results, we can calculate attack strenght for home and away team. Attack Streaght is the team's average number of goals, divided by the world cup first 3 rounds's average number of goals.<br>
<h5>Calculating Defence Strenght:</h5>
Calculating Defence Strenght is just as easy. Simply divide the team's average number of goals conceded by the world cup first 3 rounds's average number of goals conceded.<br>
Here is the results:<br>
<img src="images/attack and defence strenght.jpg">

<h5>Calculating Goal Expactancy:</h5>

Let's take first match on round16 (Netherland VS USA) As an example)<br>
To determine how many goals Netherland will likely score, we need to multiply Netherland's Attack Strenght by USA's Defence Strenght and the world cup first 3 rounds's avenrage number of goals.<br>

that gives 1.32231405*0.26446281*1.260416667=0.44077135<br><br>

To determine how many goals usa will likely score, we need to multiply usa attack strengh by Netherland defence strengh and world cup first 3 rounds's avenrage number of goals.<br>

That gives : 0.52892562*0.26446281*1.260416667=0.17630854<br><br>
<img src="images/expectency.jpg"><br><br><br>

<h5>The poisson Distribution Formula:</h5>

In its shortest form, the distribution of the number of independent events occurring in a certain interval (this interval can be time, goals, area, volume, etc.) is the Poisson distribution. For example, the number of goals in one match or event, chickens in a square meter plot of land, the number of fires in X region in 3 months, etc. Before continuing with these examples, let’s take a look at the theoretical background of the subject:<br>
<img src="images/ppoisson formula.jpg"><br><br>

In this formula:<br>
P is the probability<br>
K is the number of occurrences in the interval(number of goals)<br>
ⲗ Lambda is the expected number of goals<br>
e is Eurler's number(e=2.71828..)<br>
K! is the factorial of know.<br><br>
Of course, no game ends 1.23 vs 0.997 - this is simply the average. Poisson Distribution allows us to use these figures to distribute 100% of probability accross a range of goal outcomes for each side.
<h5>Using Poisson Dist Function in excel</h5>
To determine the prediction of number score for each, i used poission dist function in excel:
Example(Netherland VS USA):
<img src="images/poisson results.jpg"><br><br>
<b>POISSON.DIST(number of goals[0 or 1 or 2...],Team's Goal expectency, False)</b><br>
<h5>Predicting a match outcome based on these probabilities</h5>
To get each possible score, i simply multiply the probability of each possible score by each team by the probability of each possible score by the other team. that gives the following distribution:
<br>
<img src="images/tableau.jpg"><br><br>
<h5>The chance of winning table for each match</h5><br>
. To calculate the chance of an Netherland win, we add the blue squares from the table above: that gives us an estimated chance of 31%.<br>
. To calculate the chance of a usa win, we add the green squares from the table abpve: that gives as an estimated chance of 11%.<br>
. To calculate the chance of draw, we add all the brown squares from table above<br>
<br><br>
<img src="images/chances.jpg"><br><br>

<h5>Results</h5>
The Predictions were based on last 3 matchs for each team in the current Football Wold cup (Qatar 2022 World Cup), and also i removed all draws results because the coming matchs in worldcup must have a winner team.
So, as a result of using this model on predicting every match winner, the winner of the Qatar Football World Cup is may be <b>SPAIN</b>, and below are prediction of all matches from round16 to the final:<br>

<h5>Summary</h5>

. This is just a very simple way to calculate Odds.<br>
. Gives you a solid starting point for coming up with logical football predictions.<br>
. the more data you add into model, the more accurate it could be.<br>
