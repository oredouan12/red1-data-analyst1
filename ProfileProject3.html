									<h2>Data Analyst Portfolio Project</h2><br> <h4>SBA paycheck protection program Analysis</h4>
									<h4>Introduction & User Story</h4>
									<p> The US Small Business Administration assist the small business through a program called "paycheck protection program" Which is a long Data they give to the small businesses to help them pay their wokforces or, in some cases, forgive them and erase their loans, they have made some dataset related to this program<br> I will try to analyse DataSet During Covid Period in order to come out with some interesting insights.
                                    <h4>Question and hypothesis</h4>
1-The top originating lenders<br>
2- Total forgiven loans during covid period<br>
3- How many loans has been approved in 2020 - 2021<br>
4- Which Sector was getting more loans during covid period?<br>
5- Which state with most approved loans by borrowers.<br><br>
                                    <h4>Approch and Analysis</h4>
1- We are willing to work with 3 tables:<br>
    . Sba industry_standards Data table downloaded from: <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-table-size-standards">https://www.sba.gov/document/support-table-size-standards</a><br>
    
    . Ppp data dictionary, sba_public_data tables downloaded from: <a href="https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia">https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia</a><br>
    <br>
                                   
2- Formatted, cleaned in one single dataset
Statistical inference and graphical visualization will be employed.<br><br>
<h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
1 - The dataset being grouped in one file, we have many columns that are not related to our research, so they won't be considered.<br>

2- The Problem with the "NCAIS code Description field on Sba industry_standards table: There are not only section number, there is description also, so they will have to be put separately.<br><br>
                                    </p>



                              
                                    <h4>CLEANING THE DATA (SQL)</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        1- Creatig new table with lookup codes and sector name, instead of description only:<br>
                                        <pre><code>

select *
into sba_naics_sector_codes_description 
from(
    SELECT 
    [NAICS_Industry_Description],
    iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%–%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description], 8, 2 ), '') LookupCodes,
    iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%–%', ltrim(substring([NAICS_Industry_Description], CHARINDEX('–', [NAICS_Industry_Description]) + 1, LEN([NAICS_Industry_Description]) )), '') Sector
    FROM [PortfolioDB].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
    where [NAICS_Codes] = ''
    ) main
where 
LookupCodes != ''
                                        </code></pre>
2- in the Sba industry_standards table, there is some sector with 2 or more codes in description, So we need to add them to the new table:<br>
<pre><code>
SELECT TOP (1000) [NAICS_Industry_Description]
    ,[LookupCodes]
    ,[Sector]
FROM [PortfolioDB].[dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_description]
order by LookupCodes

insert into [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_description]
values 
('Sector 31 – 33 – Manufacturing', 32, 'Manufacturing'), 
('Sector 31 – 33 – Manufacturing', 33, 'Manufacturing'), 
('Sector 44 - 45 – Retail Trade', 45, 'Retail Trade'),
('Sector 48 - 49 – Transportation and Warehousing', 49, 'Transportation and Warehousing')

update  [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_description]
set Sector = 'Manufacturing'
where LookupCodes = 31


</code></pre>



                                </p>
                                <h4>Exploring The Data</h4>
<p>
    In this section, we will try to answer to question that we had before:<br>
